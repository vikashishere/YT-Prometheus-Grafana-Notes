### **Observability in Microservices**
- **Why Observability Matters**:
  - Microservices are inherently distributed, making it difficult to track system behavior.
  - Observability provides insights into the state and health of the system through logs, metrics, and traces.
  - It helps in identifying bottlenecks, detecting failures, and ensuring reliability and performance.

---

### **Monitoring Basics**
- **Definition**: Monitoring is the process of collecting and visualizing data about a systemâ€™s health and performance over time.
- **Key Questions Monitoring Answers**:
  - Is the service running?
  - Is the service functioning as expected?
  - Is the service performing within acceptable thresholds?

### **Monitoring vs. Observability**
| **Monitoring**                           | **Observability**                        |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Tracks predefined metrics.               | Offers deeper insights into unknown issues. |
| Answers "What is wrong?"                 | Answers "Why is it wrong?"               |
| Focused on system health.                | Focused on understanding internal state. |

### **Telemetry Data**
- Telemetry data includes:
  - **Metrics**: Quantitative data, e.g., CPU usage, response time.
  - **Logs**: Detailed event records.
  - **Traces**: Sequence of events showing request flow.

---

### **Methods of Metrics Collection**
1. **Push Method**:
   - Clients send data to a centralized system periodically.
   - Example: Using Prometheus **Pushgateway** for short-lived jobs.
   - Pros: Works well for dynamic, short-lived services.
   - Cons: Higher client responsibility for sending data.
   
2. **Scrape Method**:
   - Centralized system (e.g., Prometheus) pulls data from endpoints.
   - Example: Prometheus scrapes metrics from `/metrics` exposed by an exporter.
   - Pros: Decouples data collection from clients.
   - Cons: Services must expose data at specific endpoints.

---

### **Exporter and Pushgateway**
- **Exporter**:
  - A tool that exposes application or system metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format.
  - Example: Node Exporter collects system-level metrics like CPU and memory usage.

- **Pushgateway**:
  - Allows ephemeral jobs to push metrics directly to Prometheus.
  - Used when a service doesn't persist long enough for Prometheus to scrape.

---

### **Prometheus Data Model**
- Prometheus stores **time series data**.
- Each time series is identified by:
  - **Metric name**: Represents what is being measured (e.g., `http_requests_total`).
  - **Labels**: Key-value pairs for filtering and grouping (e.g., `status="200"`).
  - Example: `predict_api_hit{count="1", time_taken="600"}`.

---

### **PromQL Basics**
- PromQL is the query language for Prometheus.
- **Examples**:
  - `up`: Shows whether targets are up (1) or down (0).
  - `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`: Computes request rate over the last 5 minutes.
  - `sum by (status)(http_requests_total)`: Groups and sums requests by HTTP status.

### **Grafana Cloud**
- **Advantages**:
  - No need for setup or maintenance.
  - Automatically updated with the latest features.
  - Handles complex architectures out-of-the-box.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Higher costs for scaling.
  - Dependency on the vendor.
  - Reduced control over security and data management.

---

### **On-Premise Grafana Setup**
- **Advantages**:
  - Complete control over data and security.
  - Tailored to specific organizational needs.
  - No recurring license costs for basic features.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires infrastructure and maintenance.
  - Scalability can be challenging.
  - Manual updates and configurations.

### **Alerting in Grafana**
1. **How Alerts Work**:
   - Alerts are raised when specific conditions (rules) are met.
   - Rules are defined using queries (e.g., CPU usage > 80%).

2. **Components**:
   - **Alert Manager**: Evaluates rules and triggers alerts.
   - **Notification Policies**: Define how alerts are routed.
   - **Contact Points**: Email, Slack, PagerDuty, or other mediums for notifications.

3. **Setup Example**:
   - Define a query: `avg_over_time(cpu_usage[5m]) > 80`.
   - Configure a notification policy to send alerts to an email address.

Changes to be made on default.ini file to add your email into Grafana alert notification system:


[smtp]
enabled = true
host = smtp.gmail.com:587
user = your-email@gmail.com
password = your-generated-app-password
from_address = your-email@gmail.com
from_name = Grafana Alerts
skip_verify = true
